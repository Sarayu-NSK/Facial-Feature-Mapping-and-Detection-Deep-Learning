# Facial-Feature-Mapping-and-Detection-Deep-Learning


Dataset - http://dlib.net/files/data/ibug_300W_large_face_landmark_dataset.tar.gz

This project focuses on detecting facial landmarks (key points on the face such as eyes, nose, and mouth) using deep learning techniques. The objective is to accurately map these facial landmarks onto images for tasks like face alignment, expression recognition, or even facial recognition.

Key Components:

Dataset: The project utilizes the iBUG 300W Large Face Landmark Dataset, which contains annotated images with facial landmarks. These landmarks represent specific facial points like the corners of the eyes, lips, nose tip, etc.

Preprocessing: The dataset consists of both images and .pts files containing the coordinates of facial landmarks. The project reads and processes these files to extract the landmark points. These landmarks are then visualized by overlaying the points onto the facial images for verification and visualization.

Deep Learning Framework: The project leverages PyTorch to design and train neural networks for facial feature detection.
Data augmentations, such as rotations and translations, are applied to enhance the model’s robustness.

Model Architecture: A deep learning model (most likely a convolutional neural network or a pre-trained model like ResNet) is used for feature extraction and regression to predict the landmark points.

Training and Optimization: The model is trained using the dataset, with a loss function designed to minimize the error between the predicted and true facial landmarks.
Optimization techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent or Adam, are employed to improve the model’s performance.
Results:

The project visualizes the detected landmarks on images, allowing a comparison between the predicted and actual landmarks.
